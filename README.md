# CONNECTED-COMPONENTS-LABELING-IN-AN-IMAGE
Connected components labeling scans an image and groups its pixels into components based on pixel connectivity, i.e. all pixels in a connected component share similar pixel intensity values and are in some way connected with each other. 

Connected-component labeling is one of the most important processes for image analysis, image understanding, pattern recognition, and computer vision. 


This project consist of two approaches:
4-Adjacency (connectivity)
8-Adjacency (connectivity)
